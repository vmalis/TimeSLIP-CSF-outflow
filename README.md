# TimeSLIP-CSF-outflow
Analysis code supporting bi-component modeling of human cerebrospinal fluid outflow from Time-SLIP MRI. The method enables region-resolved quantification of fast and slow CSF transport components across parasagittal dura and venous sinus compartments and assessment of age-related changes in CSF clearance dynamics.
